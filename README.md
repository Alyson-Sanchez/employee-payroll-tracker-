Employee Payroll Tracker

A simple application that allows the user to keep track of an employees name and salary. It will also calculate an average salary and select a random employee for a giveaway. This was my first attempt at writing with Java Script. Starter code was provided via UCF - Coding Bootcamp.

The application will run on any default browser, but Chrome Dev or a similar tool is needed in order to access the average salary and the random employee function, as it writes directly to the console and will not show up on the site itself.

On the landing page the user is able to click to 'Add Employees'. The site will then prompt the user to add a first name, last name, and salary. Be sure to not put any special characters as they will not be read by the system.
Once all employees are added, the user can click 'cancel' when prompted to add a new employee, and all employees and salaries will be listed on the page: ![2024-03-20 (7)](https://github.com/Alyson-Sanchez/employee-payroll-tracker-/assets/159204375/50a8787e-a5fe-48fb-bba3-4a46c5f91be4)

Upon opening the console, the user will then see a table of employees, plus and average salary and a random employee selected as the winner of a potential giveaway.![2024-03-24 (1)](https://github.com/Alyson-Sanchez/employee-payroll-tracker-/assets/159204375/922d9868-911b-4d1f-9367-960352679eb9)
